\section{Alternation modelling and register classification}

% Motivation: Variation, Biber, Bigbert \& automatic register classification based on document-level counts of linguistic features; efforts to automatically generate document-level genre/register meta data based on such data.
% Aim: demonstrate more appropriate use of linguistic features in variational linguistic research;
% Outline: Present Biber-like feature extraction software for German; extract document-level features from corpora of newspaper and web texts; aggregate features via factor analysis; 
% In 3 short case studies of (possibly register sensitive) morpho-syntactic variation phenomena, compare the ``explanatory'' power of the resulting factors to that of (selected) raw features, i.e., not using aggregation.
