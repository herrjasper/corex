\section{Introduction}

Motivation: Variation, Biber, Bigbert \& automatic register classification based on docuement-level counts of linguistic features; efforts to automatically generate document-level genre/register meta data based on such data.
Aim: demonstrate more appropriate use of linguistic features in variational linguistic research;
Outline: Present Biber-like feature extraction software for German; extract document-level features from corpora of newspaper and web texts; aggregate features via factor analysis; 
In 3 short case studies of (possibly register sensitive) morpho-syntactic variation phenomena, compare the „explanatory“ power of the resulting factors to that of (selected) raw features, i.e., not using aggregation. 

Clarification \#1: we do not advocate ``fishing'', ``snooping'', ``hunting'': in practice, if the  study is not explicitly declared as explorative, researchers should approach a given phenomenon with clear idea of which variables are relevant, based on ``substantive theory''.

Clarification \#2: The case studies presented here are merely intended to highlight the differences between models using aggregated data and models using non-aggregated data. So we focus on the automatically extracted linguistic features, deliberately neglecting other factors that can be expected to play a role in modeling a given phenomenon.
