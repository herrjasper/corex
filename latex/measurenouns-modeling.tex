\subsubsection{Comparing aggregated with non-aggregated predictors}

For this case study, we selected all combinations of measure nouns and kind-denoting nouns that occurred at least 10 times in the published dataset\footnote{DOI/URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1254871} of \cite{Schaefer2018}. This resulted in 107 distinct combinations such as \textit{Haufen - Schrott} (`pile - junk') and \textit{Schüssel - Salat} (`bowl - salad'). We run the same automated queries that were used in \cite{Schäfer2018} a) on the DEECOW16 web corpus, and b) on a subset of DeReKo These combinations where 


instantiated by 31 distinct measure nouns and 56 distinct kind-denoting nouns.
