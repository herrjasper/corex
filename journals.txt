Corpora

Papers which contribute to corpus-based theory or methodology (e.g. building, annotation, tools, analysis, etc.) will be given precedence over those that access a corpus in order to study some aspect of linguistics.
Long papers, i.e. research papers reporting on completed corpus-based research, should be 6,000 to 10,000 words in length (that includes title, abstract, references, notes, Appendices, tables and figures).
Short papers, i.e. research papers reporting on corpus construction, the development and application of an annotation scheme, the development of automated annotation systems, etc., should be 2,500 to 4,000 words in length. 
The electronic file(s) should be .doc, .rtf or equivalent format rather than .text or .pdf.
